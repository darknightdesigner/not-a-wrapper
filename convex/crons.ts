// of the same cron is still executing — which fits the bounded reaper design.
// Both jobs are internal mutations (transactional, exactly-once per
// invocation), never actions (at-most-once, silently droppable).
//
// Deploy-boundary drain rule: these reapers assume every active-looking run
// carries lease fields written at prepare. Runs from an older
// deploy carry none and are excluded by the `undefined`-excluding index
// ranges — they are settled by the next turn's supersede sweep or a one-off
// age-thresholded pass, never by lease logic.
