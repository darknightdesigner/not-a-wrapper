 * Generation run lifecycle — the single pure brain owning the legal transitions

 * signal) → verdict, and the verdict names the run patch plus the message
 * resolution. The race rules live here, in one table:
 *
 *  - First terminal outcome wins.
 *  - `fail` may overwrite `completed` (the onError-vs-envelope race must
 *    converge to failed) but never `aborted` (a user Stop is settled).
 *  - `complete` downgrades to `awaiting_approval` while approvals pend.
 *  - `supersede` reaches only queued/running/streaming (paused runs are closed
 *    by deny-pending at next-turn prepare, never swept).
 *
 * No MutationCtx, no db access: operates on plain fact records and message
 * status values (mirrors ./message_visibility).
