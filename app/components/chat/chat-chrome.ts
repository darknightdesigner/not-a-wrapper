/**
 * The single decision site for chat-surface chrome (ADR-0017).
 *
 * The chat routes (`/`, `/c/[chatId]`, `/p/[projectId]`) hand their LayoutApp
 * header slot to Chat (`header={null}`) because the visible surface is decided
 * by CLIENT state — chatId and the rendered turn array — which flips inside a
 * shallow first-turn route handoff (and, since the immediate optimistic
 * insert, in the same frame as the send itself). A server-rendered header
 * choice cannot follow that flip: it stranded a header-less thread after a
 * project first send.
 *
 * Chat derives BOTH the surface and its header from this one resolver, so the
 * two can never disagree. Add new surfaces here, not as ad-hoc conditionals in
 * chat.tsx or per-route header slots.
