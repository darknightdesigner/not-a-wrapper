# Not A Wrapper

**Not A Wrapper** is an open-source, multi-AI chat platform with a unified interface for 80+ models across 8 providers. Compare models side-by-side, bring your own API keys, connect MCP tools, upload files, and organize conversations into projects — all from a single, clean interface.

Forked from [Zola](https://github.com/ibelick/zola) and rebuilt with Convex, Clerk, and the Vercel AI SDK.

## Features

### Core Chat
- **Multi-provider AI chat** — Stream responses from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, xAI, Perplexity, DeepSeek, and OpenRouter
- **Multi-model comparison** — Send one prompt to up to 10 models and compare responses side-by-side
- **Streaming with reasoning** — See model thinking in real-time (Claude, o3, DeepSeek R1, etc.)
- **File uploads** — Share documents, images, and code for AI analysis (Convex-backed storage)
- **Guest access** — Try the app without signing up (5 messages/day, limited model selection)

### Tools & Integrations
- **Web search** — Native provider search (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI) with Exa fallback for providers without built-in search
- **MCP support** — Connect external tool servers via the Model Context Protocol; per-tool approval, circuit breaker, and audit logging
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** — Securely use your own API keys with AES-256-GCM encryption at rest

### Organization & Sharing
- **Projects** — Group related chats into folders
- **Public sharing** — Publish chats with a shareable link and OG metadata
- **Pinned chats** — Pin important conversations for quick access
- **Chat history** — Full conversation history with search

### Personalization
- **Light / Dark / System themes** — Automatic or manual theme switching
- **Layout options** — Sidebar or fullscreen modes
- **Favorite & hidden models** — Curate your model list
- **Custom system prompts** — Set default instructions for AI behavior

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batmn-dev/not-a-wrapper.git
cd not-a-wrapper
bun install
cp .env.example .env.local   # Edit with your keys
bun dev                       # Starts Next.js + Convex dev servers
```

The app runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You need at least one AI provider key to chat.

For full setup (Clerk auth, Convex database, BYOK encryption), see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).
