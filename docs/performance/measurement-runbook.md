# Chat-performance measurement runbook

Use the deterministic browser harness for comparable performance measurements.
It covers guest and authenticated durable scenarios, enforces correctness before
reporting timings, and writes ignored JSON results under
`benchmarks/chat-performance/browser/results/`.

## Standard run

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_PERF_INSTRUMENTATION=true NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-perf bun run build:next
bun run bench:browser
```

The isolated `.next-perf` build and default benchmark port do not disturb the
developer-owned server on port 3000. Harness options and durable-suite setup are
documented in `benchmarks/chat-performance/browser/README.md`.

Interpret results using:

- `docs/performance/metric-dictionary.md` for metric definitions and privacy
  rules;
- `docs/performance/2026-08-27-system-performance-baseline.md` for the pinned
  runner class, fixture hashes, and comparison baseline.

## Reading run timing receipts (production or dev)

Every durable generation run carries a **Run timing receipt** (ADR-0030,
metric dictionary group 13). To ask "did build X slow prepare for route Y",
summarize completed runs in a window, grouped by model, route, and build:

```bash
# Last 7 days, computed at run time; change the day count to widen the window.
bunx convex run runTiming:timingSummary "{\"sinceMs\": $(( $(date +%s) * 1000 - 7*24*60*60*1000 ))}"
```

`sinceMs` is optional and defaults to the last 24 hours. Keep the window
recent: the query returns at most `"limit"` runs, newest first, so a window
holding more completed runs than the limit silently drops the oldest ones.
`scannedRuns` equal to the limit means the window was capped. Optional
filters: `"model"`, `"buildId"` (the server build identifier stamped on the
run: the short commit SHA, or the Sentry release when the SHA is unavailable),
`"limit"` (default 2000, max 5000); filters apply within the returned window
(the newest `limit` completed runs), so when `scannedRuns` equals the limit a
filtered summary can omit older matches: narrow `sinceMs` or raise `limit`.
`matchedRuns` counts the runs the filters kept. The result lists n, p50,
and max per receipt segment plus the derived `serverTimeToFirstOutputMs` and
`pacingOverheadMs`; `p95` appears only from 20 samples up (the dictionary's
non-metrics rule). Add `--prod` to read the production deployment. Compare
two builds side by side by running it twice with each `buildId`; local runs
carry no build id. Stopped runs carry the partial receipt their worker
attached after the Stop; runs the reaper closed carry none.

## Manual measurement

Use an authenticated Chrome session only when the deterministic harness does
not cover the question, such as a real-provider cadence, a third-party product
comparison, or trace-level browser paint attribution.

Keep comparisons controlled:

- use a production build, never development mode;
- record normal and 4x CPU runs;
- record desktop and representative mobile viewports;
- record warm or cold cache state;
- compare identical prompts, provider routes, and stream shapes;
- confirm the web-search state per account before a "search off" cell: the
  preference defaults to on, the composer shows no indicator, and a declared
  hosted `web_search` tool bills ~4.4K hidden input tokens on OpenAI (1,026
  on Haiku, 552 on GLM) whether or not the model searches; check
  `toolMetadataByName` on the stored message (see
  `2026-09-02-ttft-tps-vs-t3-chat.md`, Follow-up);
- separate foreground HTTP rendering from Convex snapshot/recovery timing.

Client instrumentation is build-time gated by
`NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_PERF_INSTRUMENTATION=true`. Server spans are sampled with
`CHAT_PERF_SAMPLE_RATE=<0..1>`. Join them with the generated correlation ID;
never persist that ID as application data.

## Privacy and evidence

Performance evidence must remain content-free. Never retain prompts, responses,
cookies, authorization headers, API keys, user IDs, chat IDs, or raw tool data.
Publish only aggregate metrics and stable architectural conclusions in this
repository. Raw traces, screenshots, downloaded bundles, and source-product
captures belong in ignored benchmark results or the sibling `reference-ui`
repository, not `docs/`.

Before treating instrumentation numbers as user-facing truth, compare an
instrumented and uninstrumented build of the same deterministic scenario. The
instrumented run must not introduce a new task longer than 50 ms.

## Responsiveness workflow (schema v3)

Read ADR-0037 and metric dictionary group 14. `SUITE=responsiveness` is the small
signed-in core: cold entry, follow-up after reloading its seeded conversation,
reasoning-first, long-answer interaction, one 4x CPU + constrained-network repeat,
Stop, and error recovery. Existing thread-switch and stress/recovery suites remain
separate. No real provider behavior is changed by the test.

On local machines the harness requires `PERF_CDP_URL` for an already authenticated
Chrome connection. It opens/closes its own tabs and never clears that profile's
storage. Guest suites run only in the CI browser. Do not launch another profile
or restart the user's browser to work around an unavailable connection. The Chrome
extension can validate the production build manually and read `chat_ui_perf`
console records, but this is not a controlled runner baseline.

```sh
# Build only; this command does not deploy Convex.
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_PERF_INSTRUMENTATION=true NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-perf bun run build:next
PERF_CDP_URL=http://localhost:9222 SUITE=responsiveness RUNS=5 bun run bench:browser
```

The app must already be authenticated at the benchmark's origin when attaching
Chrome. Runs that cannot send, lose foreground visibility, omit required evidence,
or fail correctness are failures. The second-tab durability scenario preserves
its first-output observations before intentionally transferring tab focus; it
makes no claim about subsequent foreground interactivity in the original tab.

Relevant same-repository PRs run the core suite. Weekly CI runs the rendering,
durability, and thread-switch suites serially against the runner's locally built production server.
Fork PRs do not receive credentials. Missing baselines fail; use the explicit
collection process in `browser/baselines/README.md`. CI records five measured runs
per scenario after a warmup; use longer captures for tail-distribution analysis.

### Validate observer overhead before enabling production collection

Use the same production commit, foreground Chrome, deterministic prompt, machine,
and network in interleaved captures with and without the observer. Compare an
external browser trace's input durations and main-thread work, not the observer's
own output. Require no added >50 ms task and investigate median overhead above
2%. Record both build IDs, observer setting, sample counts, and trace method.
The ordinary benchmark cannot substitute for this A/B.

Once validated, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_UI_SAMPLE_RATE` to a reviewed sampling rate
(for example 0.01) and rebuild. This sends only named duration distributions to
existing Sentry under `chat.ui.*`; it defaults to zero. Verify event arrival in
Sentry and compare release/device cohorts alongside native LCP/INP and the existing
server run receipts. Never pool provider routes, reasoning settings, or tool states
in a real-provider first-output comparison. Treat timeouts/errors as outcomes,
not missing observations to discard.

## Deterministic counts and payload budgets (ADR-0049)

Counts answer "how much work did this interaction do", independent of machine
speed. Metric dictionary group 15 defines them.

```sh
# Build only; this command does not deploy Convex.
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_PERF_INSTRUMENTATION=true NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-perf bun run build:next
RUNS=5 bun run bench:counts       # owned server on PERF_PORT (default 3122), fresh guests
bun run bench:counts --compare base.json head.json
```

Captures land in `benchmarks/chat-performance/browser/results/counts/` and print
each count per run with `stable` when all runs agree. The result's
`topComponents` lists the component types with the most hook renders; production
names are minified, so each carries its first DOM element as a hint
(`<span data-slot=tooltip-trigger>`). The responsiveness pair in CI captures
both builds and fails on any gated increase or unstable gated count.

Payload budgets run with the unit tests:

```sh
bunx vitest run convex/payloadBudgets.seam.test.ts
```

When a change is intended, paste the `PAYLOAD_BUDGETS` object printed by the
failure into the test. Bytes are exact, so any growth fails; a failure for
being more than 1% below budget means the win should be locked in the same way.
