# Metric dictionary — chat performance

Date: 2026-08-27. This is the naming and interpretation contract for every chat-performance metric —
existing, proxy, and proposed. Phase 3/4 report against these names; nothing may report
under a name not defined here.

**Status update (2026-08-27, Phase 2 landed):** the schema defects are fixed
(`deduped` checkpoint kind accepted; `stream_terminal` reports `abort` after a Stop
intent; `request_parse`/`model_config`/`history_adaptation` now emitted), the
receipt-anchored server spans, provider first-event/first-text spans, transport taps,
Stop mark, rAF-coalescer publication summary, projection/Shiki durations, long-task and
rAF-gap observers, per-op `durable_write` timings, `settlement_total`, and the sampled
Convex-side read/write bucket logs (`CHAT_PERF_CONVEX_SAMPLE_RATE`, `_tag:
"chat_perf_convex"`) all exist. Rows below are annotated individually; `proposed` rows
that remain are harness-derived (Phase 3) or deferred to an experiment.

**Status update (2026-09-01, ADR-0030):** provider timing now has one source — the AI
SDK's per-step `performance` (`timeToFirstOutputMs`, `responseTimeMs`,
`toolExecutionMs`), sampled on a monotonic clock upstream of every
`experimental_transform`. The former `provider_first_event` span was measured in the
SDK chunk callback, which runs AFTER the word-chunking transform, so for the one
smoothing-eligible model (Claude Haiku 4.5) it included this server's own holdback
delay; its rows in the 2026-08-27 baseline are post-transform contaminated for that
model and must not be compared with the re-sourced figure. `provider_first_event` is
retired; `provider_first_output` replaces it; `provider_first_text_delta` moves to the
transport group with its true meaning. The same step figures feed the always-on **Run
timing receipt** on the generation run (group 13) and the user-facing **Generation
stats** on the assistant message.

## Global rules

- **Privacy class — all metrics are `content-free`.** No metric or dimension may carry
  prompts, outputs, tool arguments, attachment names, secrets, user IDs, chat IDs, run
  IDs, or raw trace contents. Enforcement is the schema allow-list +
  `validateChatPerfEvent` (`lib/observability/chat-performance.ts:118-253`), which
  rejects unknown events, unknown fields, enum violations, and secret-shaped strings.
  Sizes and counts are reported as power-of-2 buckets, not exact values, when they could
  correlate with content.
- **Correlation.** Client marks and server spans join on `correlationId` (the per-send
  `x-chat-perf-id` UUID; one-shot, never persisted, never crosses into Convex). Convex
  measurements are statistical (sampled, bucketed) — they never join per-request.
- **Composite metrics must decompose.** No result may report a single combined "TTFT"
  without the component stages that sum to it. `send_to_first_visible_text` is reported
  only alongside its parts (dispatch gap, server prep, provider first-text, transport,
  render).
- **Status legend.** `existing` = emitted today · `proxy` = emitted today but measures a
  stand-in for the named thing (limitation noted) · `proposed` = Phase 2 work.
- **Gate?** = eligible as a CI/benchmark regression gate. Only deterministic,
  provider-free metrics gate. Real-provider metrics are smoke-labeled and never gate.
- Units: durations in `ms` (float), sizes in `bytes` (bucketed where noted), counts
  dimensionless.

| `nav_to_thread_painted`      | `chat_navigation_intent` (sidebar row click) → `nav_to_thread_painted` (two rAFs after the commit that first rendered a message row for the destination chat) | browser                 | yes (harness `SUITE=thread-switch`) | existing (2026-09-02)                                                                                                                           |
| `time_to_typeable`           | navigation start → first frame the composer accepts input (server fallback textarea visible and enabled, or the ProseMirror editor editable)                  | browser                 | no (`composer-handoff.ts`, guest)   | ADR-0047 (2026-10-09); compare to editor editable (the pre-ADR-0047 typeable point); the script's handoff cases are pass/fail                   |

Interpretation and limitations:

- `optimistic_message_painted` and `first_visible_text` fire from `useEffect` —
  **commit-time, not paint-time**. Under the deterministic harness the commit→paint gap is
  measured separately (`delta_to_paint`, group 5); a paint-adjacent variant of
  `first_visible_text` is proposed via the rAF-chain technique.
- `request_dispatched` fires from the transport at the actual `fetch()` (Phase 2); the
  old status-transition proxy is gone, so `send_to_request_dispatched` now includes the
  pre-fetch client work (`chat-turn-controller.ts:371-419`) it used to hide.
- `send_to_first_visible_text` includes provider latency; report it only decomposed and
  never compare across providers/models as one population.
- `nav_to_thread_painted` pairs only with a sidebar click (the intent arms the next route
  commit); hard loads and Back/Forward emit no pair. The harness reports it per
  population — unvisited (click / hover-then-click) and visited — beside the commit-time
  `navigation_cache_hit_or_miss` split and the Convex query-set `Add` count per switch.
- Allowed dimensions: `textLengthBucket` (on `first_visible_text`), scenario, viewport,
  cpuThrottle, warm/cold (harness-supplied, result-file only).

## 2. Server preparation (Next.js) — `server_span` events

All are durations with `ok`, sampled by `CHAT_PERF_SAMPLE_RATE`, joined by
`correlationId`. None include provider latency; all include Convex round-trip latency
where noted, so none are strictly deterministic in production. Under the deterministic
harness (local Convex, fixed fixtures) they gate with generous ceilings.

Interpretation: `prepare_total` + admission spans + `auth_session` approximate the plan's
"server preparation excluding provider" (working target 250–300 ms p95). Sub-spans are
nested, not additive across groups — never sum overlapping spans.

Smoke-suite only; labeled by provider+model+route tier; never a population with other
providers. Dimensions: provider, model, route tier (platform/BYOK), warm/cold credential
path. Reasoning counts as output here, exactly as in the SDK's definition, so a hidden
thinking phase is inside this figure.

`long_task` and `raf_gap` retain `observedStartMs` plus `durationMs`. Their
aggregates include full observed intervals overlapping Send through terminal,
even when the observer callback or next frame arrives after terminal. They do not
classify work by the later User Timing mark timestamp.

## 12. Cost proxies (baseline-only, no targets yet)

`convex_reads_per_streamed_minute`, `convex_writes_per_streamed_minute`,
`reactive_result_bytes_per_streamed_minute`, `subscription_updates_per_streamed_minute`,
`snapshot_acceptance_ratio`, `provider_duration_ms` + token counts where the provider
reports them (smoke suite only). Sources: Convex deployment metrics + the counters in
groups 8–9, aggregated per scenario in the result file.

## 13. Run timing receipt (always-on, per generation run — ADR-0030)

Stored on the `generationRuns` row (`timingReceipt`) by every terminal write, durable
turns only; mirrored per sampled turn (guest turns included) as the `run_timing_receipt`
perf event, durations only. Every segment is a `performance.now()` difference in the
Next.js process (wall-clock steps cannot corrupt it); every field optional; absent =
unobserved, never zero. Per run — never accumulated across an approval continuation.
A user Stop or supersession lands the stopped worker's partial receipt through the
single-use receipt-attach capability (`attachRunTimingReceipt`, authenticated against
the digest the Stop transaction copied onto the run); a run that dies without any
worker write (reap) has none. Read with `runTiming:timingSummary` (see the runbook).

Derived at read time, never stored:

- `serverTimeToFirstOutputMs = prepareMs + providerFirstOutputMs + firstWriteDelayMs`.
  "First output" is the SDK's definition (§3): text, reasoning, tool-input delta, tool
  call, or file, so it can precede the first text token. Nothing here is a "time to
  first token"; `provider_first_text_delta` (§4) is the text-specific, post-transform figure.
- `pacingOverheadMs = wireStreamMs − (modelResponseMs − providerFirstOutputMs) −
toolExecutionMs` — what the response pipeline added on top of the provider's own
  output window. Watch this when touching smoothing or the UI-stream conversion.
  Hosted-tool part conversion is inside it (≈100 ms observed on an OpenAI web-search
  turn versus 1–3 ms on plain turns): compare like with like, never a mixed population.

The harness gates `prepareMs`, `firstWriteDelayMs`, `pacingOverheadMs`, and
`settlementTotalMs` (from the span) in `compare-results.ts`, on sampled summaries only
(a gated metric the baseline sampled but the current run did not fails the comparison
rather than reading as 0); the provider segments are
checked against the deterministic script's scheduled delays and invalidate the run when
they disagree. `timingSummary` reports p50/max per segment and withholds p95 under 20
samples, per the non-metrics rule below; its `model`/`buildId` filters apply within the
returned window (the newest `limit` completed runs), so when `scannedRuns` equals the
limit a filtered summary can omit older matches: narrow `sinceMs` or raise `limit`.
`matchedRuns` counts the runs the filters kept.

**Generation stats (user-facing, message-level — same provider figures):** time to first
output = `providerFirstOutputMs` of the first run's first step (persisted on the message as
`timeToFirstTokenMs`, a stored name kept for existing rows; the label reads "first output");
the output window is Σ per output step of (response − time to first output); **tokens per second = visible
(output − reasoning) tokens ÷ output window**. Providers that hide reasoning (OpenAI)
generate it before the first output chunk, inside time to first output, so counting it
would inflate the rate by exactly the hidden share (live: 271 tokens incl. 128 reasoning
over 1,284 ms read 211 tok/s for text that streamed at 111). Providers that stream
thinking inside the window read conservatively instead — never inflated. Hosted tool
calls are counted (`providerToolCalls`) because their time stays in the window.

## Non-metrics (explicitly out of contract)

- Any single undifferentiated "TTFT" number.
- Wall-clock comparisons across different machines, build classes, or provider
  populations.
- `p95` on sample sets smaller than 20 — report median/max only and say so.

## 14. DOM/frame responsiveness contract (schema v3, ADR-0037)

Summary p50 is the conventional median, averaging the middle pair for even sample
counts. The p75/p95 rank formulas remain unchanged. Schema v2's upper-middle
summaries are incompatible; version checks and raw-sample validation reject them.

These names are separate from the older React-effect marks. A frame observation
checks DOM in a rendering callback, then records in a task after that rendering
opportunity; it is not a compositor timestamp or an upper bound on presentation.
`dom-frame-v3` retains the single-frame-plus-task proxy and rejects v1/v2 captures.
When committed source is initially hidden by a finite reveal animation, the
observer follows its first visible frame instead of waiting for another stream
mutation or animation completion. Rescans require a matching source watermark,
viewport intersection, and an active finite animation, and stop when its remaining
duration expires. Pending content remains explicit if it never becomes visible.
Benchmark native scroll presentation is separate from these DOM/frame proxies.
If Chromium forks the scroll's compositor frame, exact input and submitted-frame
IDs identify its native presentation endpoint. IDs are preserved losslessly;
missing or ambiguous links fail rather than selecting a nearby frame or swap time.
`contentFrameProtocol: publisher-frame-v1` adds a guarded observation after an
SDK publication inside rAF. A committed watermark can be inspected in that same
rendering opportunity, avoiding an extra frame when the ordinary observer ran
before the publisher. Deferred commits keep the normal fallback; both endpoints
remain post-render-opportunity task proxies, with no fixed frame subtraction.
Production aggregates include the protocol tags.

The observation tab must remain visible.

| Metric | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `navigationToComposerInputMs` | Navigation start to the frame following the first successfully entered probe text. Includes driver scheduling; an upper bound, not an inferred hydration timestamp. |
| `navigationToSendControlEnabledMs` | Navigation start to visual Send enablement with probe text present; does not establish account admission. |
| `navigationToSendReadyMs` | Navigation start to an observation with both an enabled Send control and the matching-account admission predicate satisfied (`accountReadinessProtocol: matching-account-v1`). |
| `navigationToThreadFrameMs` | Navigation start to conversation content observed across a frame opportunity. |
| `inputToOptimisticFrameMs` | Activating click/Enter timestamp, confirmed by the guarded Composer submit handler, to the new user message visible across a frame opportunity. Menu-consumed Enter does not begin a turn. |
| `inputToFirstTextFrameMs` | Same input to nonempty current-turn assistant Markdown across a frame opportunity. |
| `inputToFirstActivityFrameMs` | Same input to an inspectable activity disclosure. Bare Thinking does not satisfy it. |
| `typingToFrameMs` | Oldest unobserved key/beforeinput timestamp to an editor update observed across a frame opportunity. Coalesced input retains the oldest delay; no slow-sample cutoff. |
| `menuToFrameMs` | Primary pointerdown or Enter/Space opening intent to visible composer menu across a frame opportunity; standalone accessibility activation clicks fall back to click. Includes native mousedown opening work. Closing/cancelling clears intent (`menuProtocol: activation-v1`). |
| `scrollToFrameMs` | Production DOM/frame proxy from eligible vertical wheel input to observed thread movement. The benchmark disables this geometry-reading wheel observer. |
| `scrollInputToPresentationMs` | Diagnostic total from synthetic wheel generation through explicit native presentation. Includes CDP visual-state synchronization before forwarding; not physical-wheel latency. |
| `scrollAutomationDispatchMs` | Diagnostic synthetic-generation to `GenerationToBrowserMain` endpoint. Includes the CDP pre-forward visual-state barrier. |
| `scrollBrowserToPresentationMs` | Gated browser-forwarding endpoint to explicit native presentation on the uniquely matched scroll interval. Excludes automation dispatch and OS input queuing; not a physical-pixel timestamp. |
| `deltaToContentFrameMs` | A sampled received-text watermark to an at-least-equal rendered-source watermark in a visible Markdown container across a frame opportunity. Four samples/sec maximum; no provider gaps included. |
| `typingToFrameEarlyMs` / `typingToFrameLateMs`, `menuToFrameEarlyMs` / `menuToFrameLateMs`, `deltaToContentFrameEarlyMs` / `deltaToContentFrameLateMs` | Harness phases: early interaction after first text; late interaction after at least 80% of the deterministic fixture source is rendered while the stream remains active. Each phase must produce samples in every run. |
| `terminalToReadyFrameMs` | Transport finish/error to idle composer state across a frame opportunity. Local Stop without a transport finish does not invent a terminal event. |
| `stopToReadyFrameMs` | Stop click to visible idle composer state, even when blank Send is disabled. |
| `threadSwitchToFrameMs` | Sidebar click to changed destination content across a frame opportunity, with destination URL checked. |
| `lcpMs` | Last observed browser LCP entry; diagnostic, not composer readiness. |
| `eventTimingEntryMs` | Each delivered Event Timing entry's duration (16 ms reporting threshold); diagnostic, not a logical interaction maximum or session INP. Multiple events may share an interaction ID. |

The fixed normal-profile budgets are defined in `result-contract.ts`. Result JSON
retains raw content-free samples so budget-exceedance rates can be recomputed.
Under the 2026-09-05 ADR-0037 policy clarification, capture validity/compatibility,
relative regression, and these absolute targets are reported independently.
Strict comparison remains the default and gates all three. Explicit
`--regression-only` still gates validity and regressions while separately reporting
unchanged target failures; a valid but slow reference is permitted only under that
policy. Its success does not mean the interface meets the absolute targets.
PR comparisons pair original main product code and the candidate on the same
runner/browser with identical measurement hooks, fixtures, and configuration.
Scheduled and default manual comparisons capture the current revision's first
parent on that same runner; stored CPU baselines are not a workflow prerequisite.
Missing or incompatible reference evidence fails and leaves regression
**NOT EVALUATED**; collecting one capture cannot establish regression protection.
Summaries must match their raw observations. Every text scenario requires a
content-latency sample per run. Early/late typing, menu, and content phases use
the same absolute budgets independently, so setup samples cannot dilute a slow
late-stream phase. Completed foreground runs must drain
all sampled received content; pending counts remain explicit for Stop, reload, and
intentional second-tab cutoffs. Any observation-buffer overflow invalidates a run.
Readiness requires global `accountReadinessProtocol: matching-account-v1`.
The original-base overlay publishes the same observation-only admission predicate
without changing its product gate; earlier readiness captures are incompatible.
Native benchmark scrolling requires `wheelProtocol: native-browser-presentation-v2` and
`interactionProtocol: late-typing-native-wheel-menu-v2`. The isolated wheel's
event timestamp and UserTiming anchor select a unique category/process/local async
track. Version 2 identifies the exact submitted scroll frame using input, surface,
and display IDs plus its native frame-swap timestamp, even if the original input
track later presents a main frame. Direct attribution requires the independent
submission path to be unavailable. Version 1 captures are incompatible and cannot
be relabeled. Lost, missing, ambiguous, or
incomplete evidence fails. Native traces remain CI artifacts; normal runs do not
CPU-profile. Production wheel observation remains a movement proxy, invalidated by
cancellation, competing input, navigation, or application scroll commands.
Stop correctness checks assistant source length at idle feedback, 250 ms later,
and after the terminal/settlement wait and settling buffer. Each checkpoint must
be no longer than the preceding one; shorter canonical snapshots remain valid.
These checkpoints do not claim continuous observation between samples.
Authenticated Stop runs require a durable settlement receipt before the final check.
`n=0` means absent. p95 is omitted below 20 observations. Repeated keystrokes from
one run do not replace the requirement for at least five complete journey runs.
Cold means HTTP cache disabled (CI also creates a fresh context with the benchmark
session); authenticated Chrome preserves the person's storage and cookies. Warm
uses cached assets in fresh documents; the visited thread-switch pass separately
measures navigation within a live document.

## 15. Deterministic interaction counts and payload budgets (ADR-0049)

Counts of work per interaction, not durations. `bench:counts` drives a fresh guest
on an owned production server with reduced motion emulated, drains frames after
every keystroke, and repeats at 1x and 4x CPU. A gated count must be identical in
every run; the paired PR gate fails when the candidate exceeds the merge base.

Interactions: `composer-typing` (26 characters into the idle home composer) and
`composer-menu-open` (guest plus popover, after its hover tooltip settles). Counts
are per interaction, never per second. The hook stub runs only in the benchmark
browser; production builds never install it.
