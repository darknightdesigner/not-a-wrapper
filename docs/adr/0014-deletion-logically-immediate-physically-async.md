# 14. Deletion is logically immediate and physically asynchronous

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-07-23
- Related: implementation shipped in PR #128; this ADR retains the operating
  decision and blocked-job runbook.

## Context

A Chat's durable graph is unbounded, while one Convex mutation may read at most
16 MiB. The former synchronous deletion path read the complete owned graph
before deleting it, so snapshot-heavy Chats could not be deleted. Routine
assistant snapshots also duplicated cumulative content and caused the graph to
grow much faster than the visible conversation.

## Decision

Deletion is a two-stage operation:

1. The authenticated owner mutation tombstones the Chat or Project. Every read
   and write surface treats that logical root as missing immediately. A linked
   Project is the Chat's logical ancestor: Chat-bound access reads both the Chat
   and its Project and fails closed when either is missing or tombstoned.
2. A `deletionJobs` state machine drains one bounded child-table page per
   scheduled mutation. Destructive pages always restart at `cursor: null`;
   attachments use bounded `take` reads and an in-transaction
   `by_storage.take(2)` exclusivity check. Chat roots are deleted only after
   every child range is empty, and Project roots are deleted only after every
   linked Chat is gone.

Run-level `lastSnapshotSequence` preserves the accepted-checkpoint invariant
without retaining cumulative snapshot rows.

Jobs are idempotent, keep content-free document/byte counters, and schedule
their next batch atomically. Unexpected invariant or storage failures convert a
job to `blocked`; jobs are never auto-untombstoned or automatically resumed.
The reconciler only restarts stale `pending` or `running` jobs. It reports a
bounded count of `blocked` jobs without mutating or scheduling them.

Collection reads that can include project-linked Chats post-filter their bounded
result set through the same parent-aware rule. Parent ids are de-duplicated and
pagination metadata is preserved; a page may therefore underfill while a
Project deletion is draining. Because these Project reads occur in the same
reactive query or mutation, Convex invalidation and optimistic concurrency
ordering make the tombstone authoritative without fan-out writes to child
Chats.

## Consequences

- Deletion disappears from the product immediately while physical reclamation
  is eventual and observable through `deletionJobs`.
- Tombstoning a Project immediately hides and write-disables its linked Chats,
  even before the coordinator reaches their individual roots.
- Large Chats and Projects take multiple transactions but no transaction reads
  the complete graph.
- Existing tombstones must remain hidden through rollback. Reverting the async
  writer stops new tombstones, but partially cleaned roots must never be
  un-tombstoned; their jobs resume after the implementation is re-deployed.

## Amendment (2026-09-27): account deletion

ADR-0044 adds a third job kind, `targetKind: "account"`, on the same state
machine. The deleted account is the logical root: its users row stays as a
tombstone, and `isChatActive` reads the chat owner's row, so every chat-bound
surface (share links included) treats the account's Chats as missing at the
moment of deletion. The job drains every owned Chat through the Chat phases
(closing live runs first, like Project jobs), then Project roots, staged
attachments, and the account-owned tables, and finally scrubs the tombstone's
personal fields. It refuses to run for an account that is not deleted.

## Blocked-job runbook

Inspect the job's content-free `failureCode` in the Convex dashboard and fix the
underlying cause. Resume the same idempotent job with:

```bash
bunx convex run deletionCleanup:resumeBlockedDeletionJob '{"jobId":"<id from dashboard>"}'
```

The resume mutation changes only `blocked` jobs back to `pending` and schedules
the existing entry point. Do not clear the root tombstone.
