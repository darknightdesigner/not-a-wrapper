# 0021 — Platform usage allowance: append-only ledger with materialized buckets

**Status:** accepted **Date:** 2026-08-19 **Amends:** ADR-0020 (the
`PlatformEntitlement` seam gains its planned balance implementation: platform
candidacy now requires an atomic reservation, not just list membership) and
ADR-0011 (durable settlement gains an accounting half: every terminal
transition also settles or releases the run's usage reservation).
**Amended:** 2026-08-28 — cancellation-aware settlement (see
"Cancellation-aware settlement" below): a user Stop or supersession no longer
converts the worst-case admission reservation into final spend. 2026-09-27 —
cached input settles at the cache-read rate, and provider-side retention and
actor attribution are recorded (see "Provider retention and attribution").

**Context.** ADR-0020 made Priority/Fallback API-key preferences real routing
tiers, but the platform tier admits by list membership (`FREE_MODELS_IDS`)
with no economic bound beyond the daily message counters — which conflate
abuse control with spend control, charge BYOK messages against a "pro model"
counter, and are enforced as a check-then-increment pair (a classic
time-of-check/time-of-use race). The product goal (T3-style included
allowance): platform-funded messages reserve estimated cost before provider
execution, settle actual cost afterward, and BYOK messages never touch the
included allowance.

**Decision.** One included allowance bucket per user per plan period,
maintained as a **materialized balance** whose every change is evidenced by an
**append-only ledger entry**, with reservation/settlement performed inside
single Convex mutations (transactional, OCC-serialized).

## Allowance unit and rounding

- **1 credit = 1 micro-USD (10⁻⁶ USD) of platform cost.** All grants,
  reservations, balances, and settled costs are integers in this unit.
  Floating-point dollars never enter accounting.
- Route rates are compiled once from the catalog's numeric
  `inputCost`/`outputCost` (USD per 1M tokens) into integer
  `inputCreditsPerMTok`/`outputCreditsPerMTok` (micro-USD per 1M tokens).
  The human-readable `priceUnit` string is display-only and never parsed.
- **Rounding:** deterministic `ceil` once per billable component (input
  tokens, output tokens, title input, title output) — never per token, never
  per delta. `ceil` is chosen so a fractional micro-USD never silently rounds
  platform cost to zero.
- A route without valid numeric pricing is **not platform-fundable** (fails
  closed). An explicitly free route ($0.00 rates) is fundable at zero credits.
- **Cached input** (amended 2026-09-27): a route whose catalog declares
  `cachedInputCost` also pins `cacheReadCreditsPerMTok` in its snapshot.
  Settlement charges the provider-reported cache-read share of input at that
  rate and the rest at the input rate (a third component, `ceil` once); a
  missing rate or count falls back to the full input rate, and reservations
  stay at the full rate. Only gpt-5-mini declares one today, on both of its
  routes: the direct record states it, and the generated OpenRouter route
  takes it from the snapshot's `pricing.input_cache_read` (ADR-0007), so the
  rate follows whichever route the platform tier picks. Cache writes are
  not priced separately because no metered route bills them yet; Claude
  requests turn prompt caching on, so a platform-funded Claude route must
  first price writes (1.25x input).
- The UI presents percentages of the included allowance, never raw credits or
  dollars.

## Plan policy (provisional grant sizes — product confirmation required)

Centralized in one typed module (`convex/domain/usage_plan_policy.ts`). The
grant sizes below are **provisional placeholders** pending product-owner
confirmation; changing them is a one-constant edit:

| Plan       | Selector               | Included grant / period     | Refill interval    | Renewal anchor                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| free-v1    | default                | 1,000,000 credits ($1.00)   | UTC calendar month | month boundary (no per-user anchor) |
| premium-v1 | `users.premium ⩵ true` | 10,000,000 credits ($10.00) | UTC calendar month | month boundary (no per-user anchor) |

- **Bucket identity:** `(userId, bucketKind: "included", periodKey)` where
  `periodKey` is the UTC month (`"2026-08"`). Lazy creation: the first
  **reservation** of a period materializes the bucket; allowance **reads**
  project the plan's would-be grant virtually until then (Convex queries
  cannot write, and a reactive subscription must not mint rows). The
  grant ledger entry's idempotency key is `grant:{userId}:{periodKey}`, so
  the grant is idempotent by construction.
- Unused allowance does **not** roll over; a new period starts a new bucket.
  A negative prior-period balance does not carry forward (the block it
  imposed ends at the next grant — the spec's "until the next applicable
  grant").
- **Plan changes** take effect at the next bucket materialization (the
  current period's bucket keeps its `planId` and grant). **Pricing changes**
  never touch history: a reservation and its settlement use the pricing
  snapshot captured at reservation time, and ledger entries are never edited.

## Data model

- `usageBuckets` — materialized balance. Invariant (pinned by tests):
  `availableCredits = grantedCredits − spentCredits − reservedCredits`.
  Admission requires `availableCredits ≥ estimatedCredits`. Settlement may
  drive `availableCredits` negative (an actual-over-reservation overrun is
  recorded, never clamped); a negative balance blocks later reservations
  until the next grant.
- `usageReservations` — one durable record per platform-funded generation
  request, keyed by the authenticated `(userId, requestId)` before the run
  exists and attached to `generationRunId` transactionally inside
  `prepareGeneration`. Carries the pricing snapshot, estimate, payload
  fingerprint, status (`reserved → settled | released`), settlement basis,
  and final usage. Never key material.
- `usageLedgerEntries` — append-only evidence. Event types
  `grant | reserve | settle | release | adjustment` with deterministic
  idempotency keys (`reserve:{reservationId}`, `settle:{reservationId}`, …),
  enforced by an indexed read inside the same mutation. Historical entries
  are never updated or deleted; corrections are compensating `adjustment`
  entries. The bucket is the fast read model; the ledger is the audit and
  repair source.

Logical uniqueness (one bucket per period, one reservation per request, one
ledger entry per event key) is enforced by indexed reads inside the mutation
that inserts — Convex serializable transactions + OCC retries make this
race-free without SQL unique constraints.

## Atomic operations

- **Reserve** (`usageAllowance.reserveAuthorized`, authenticated mutation,
  called by the server-side route resolver walking platform candidates): verify a
  short-lived HMAC authorization over the authenticated WorkOS subject and
  EVERY immutable reservation fact → ensure current bucket → idempotency
  check on `(userId, requestId)` (an identical fingerprint on a STILL-RESERVED
  row replays; a different fingerprint, or any replay of a settled/released
  row, is a typed conflict — settled or refunded money is never re-admitted)
  → admission check → atomically decrement available, increment reserved,
  insert reservation + `reserve` ledger entry. Typed results are `reserved`,
  `insufficient_allowance`, `idempotent_replay`, `conflict`, and `rate_limited`.
  Although Convex registers the mutation publicly so the Next route can call
  it with the user's JWT, an authenticated browser cannot mint the required
  server authorization. Its domain-separated tuple covers identity, request,
  chat, route, token estimates, integer credit estimate, and the complete
  pricing snapshot. A per-user throttle of 30 requests per minute remains
  defense in depth for abuse through the legitimate server route;
  reconciliation capacity is
  no longer a security boundary for arbitrary client-created rows. There is
  no separate "check balance" query; the reservation IS the admission.
- **Attach**: `prepareGeneration` receives `reservationId` inside the signed
  admission proof (ADR-0020's HMAC tuple gains the reservation id) and
  patches `reservation.generationRunId = runId` in the same transaction that
  creates the run — a forged attach is impossible without the server proof.
- **Settle** (`settleUsageForTerminalRun`, invoked inside the same Convex
  mutation that commits the terminal lifecycle transition): for reservation
  R and actual A — `available += R − A`, `reserved −= R`, `spent += A`,
  reservation → `settled`, one `settle` ledger entry. Idempotent: a second
  settlement with the same facts returns without balance change; a
  conflicting second settlement is logged as an invariant violation and
  rejected.
- **Release** (only when provider consumption definitely did not begin):
  `available += R`, `reserved −= R`, spent unchanged. Pre-run failures use
  the unattached-release mutation (`releaseUnattached`, releases only the
  caller's own reservation while `generationRunId` is still unset — provider
  work structurally cannot have started without a run); the route arms its
  release hook the moment the reservation exists, before anything else in
  admission can throw. Settle-after-release and release-after-settle are
  rejected and logged.
- **Adjust** (`recordAdjustment`, internal-only): the ONE sanctioned
  administrative correction — appends a compensating `adjustment` ledger
  entry (caller-supplied `adjustment:*` idempotency key) and moves
  `grantedCredits` + `availableCredits` together so the materialized
  invariant keeps holding; history is never edited.

## Durable lifecycle accounting (the provider boundary rule)

**Evidence beats the boundary marker.** The current worker commits
`run.workStartedAt` before provider dispatch and awaits its acknowledgement. A
lost acknowledgement can leave the marker committed even though the worker
correctly refuses dispatch, so trusted worker `not-started` evidence releases
when no durable usage exists. Without worker evidence, the marker remains the
conservative fallback. The settlement decision, in order:

## Cancellation-aware settlement (amended 2026-08-28)

**Reservation is not spend.** The worst-case output reservation is an
admission-control fact; treating an unknown cancellation as proof the entire
reservation was consumed overcharged every first-step Stop. The amendment
separates **visible terminality** (immediate, unchanged: Stop commits
`aborted/user_stop` and revokes the normal execution grant in one
transaction) from **accounting finality** (deferred to a bounded
cancellation-evidence window). No user-facing state is added — accounting
pending is represented only on the reservation, which keeps
`status: "reserved"` (so the amount stays in `bucket.reservedCredits`,
fail-closed for concurrent admission) plus `terminalPendingAt`,
`settlementDeadlineAt`, `providerMayHaveStarted`, and durable
`terminalEstimatedOutputTokens` partial-output fallback captured before
run/message cleanup can erase it. Protocol-v1 reservations mirror the durable
dispatch-authorization marker, completed-step tokens, and title evidence. A
Stop that wins before the marker releases immediately; a Stop after the
marker defers. Trusted worker `not-started` evidence still releases, while a
missing worker receipt lets the deadline fallback charge from the strongest
mirrored evidence. Approval continuations additionally freeze
`generationRuns.resumedOutputTokensBaseline` at prepare (the partial-output
estimate over the reused message's parts, already billed to the paused run's
settled reservation); every partial-output estimate for the continuation —
deferral capture, lease fallback, and worker-supplied receipt values alike —
is reduced by that baseline so a stopped continuation never rebills the prior
run's output. Direct chat deletion and every child processed by project
deletion route live runs through the same supersede close (terminalize +
defer, seeding these pending facts) BEFORE tombstoning, so deletion cannot
erase the only settlement evidence.

**Settlement-only authorization.** The Stop/supersede transaction copies the
run's grant digest to `usageReservations.settlementGrantDigest` (expiring at
the same `settlementDeadlineAt`, derived from the execution budget's
settlement reserve) while clearing the run grant as before. The stopped
worker's secret then authorizes exactly ONE narrowly scoped operation — the
`finalizeTerminalUsage` worker-wire receipt for its exact run/reservation
pair — and nothing else: no snapshots, tools, approvals, heartbeats, or
lifecycle writes. Wrong-run, wrong-digest, expired, malformed, and replayed
receipts are rejected without balance changes; a receipt against an
already-finalized reservation is acknowledged as a benign no-op.

**Protocol contract.** Reservation authorizations require the pinned title
input floor, and chat admission proof v4 binds both generation-budget and
cancellation-settlement facts. Older proof formats are rejected. Optional
fields represent genuinely absent runtime facts, not a migration path.

**Evidence order (deterministic, shared by receipt and reaper —
`resolveTerminalUsageSettlement`):**

1. provider work definitely never began → release (primary and an un-run
   title component);
2. authoritative aggregate usage → priced at the pinned primary route
   (`actual`; may honestly exceed the reservation);
3. completed-step usage → priced as `observed_partial`; the persisted
   partial-output estimate combines by `max()`, never by addition;
4. started without usage → `estimatedInputTokens` only
   (`estimated_input_floor`), plus a bounded estimate of persisted partial
   output when any exists (`estimated_input_with_partial_output`).

Locally estimated fallbacks are capped at the reservation — but the cap
bounds the ESTIMATED component only: a provider-reported actual title rides
above the capped estimate (honest overrun, invariant "provider-reported
actual may exceed"), never inside it. The partial estimate is capped at
`estimatedOutputTokens`. The partial-output estimator
(`lib/usage/terminal-usage-estimate.ts`) counts model output only — text,
reasoning, tool-call names + arguments — never tool results or user content.

**Title settles independently** via `titleSettlementBasis`
(`actual | input_floor | not_run`): zero when no attempt started; actual
route-pinned usage when observed; otherwise `titleEstimatedInputTokens` (the
input floor of the exact clipped title prompt, pinned at reservation time and
signed into the reservation authorization via a versioned v1→v2 proof
expansion) priced at the attempted pinned route, capped by the reserved title
component. An unknown route identity is logged and priced at the pinned
title floor. The worker durably records title start before provider dispatch
and route-aware actual usage after completion. Both facts are mirrored to the
reservation. Deadline and lease fallbacks therefore use actual usage when
available, the title input floor after an acknowledged start, and zero only
when no durable title attempt exists.

**Deadline finality.** The first finalization wins — worker receipt, deadline
reconciler (`reconcileDueTerminalSettlements`, second-level cadence, bounded,
immediately scheduling another bounded pass whenever a batch is full), or the
30-minute stale reconciler as the final crash/deploy net (pending rows route
through the same fallback, never the legacy full-estimate charge). Later
conflicting evidence is logged
(`usage_terminal_late_evidence_ignored`) and can never rebill. A worker-owned
abort that beats any Stop still settles atomically: its terminal write
carries the same normalized evidence. `estimated_after_unknown_usage`
remains readable on historical rows and is never written for new
`user_stop`/`superseded` settlements.

Per-step usage evidence: `recordToolInvocations` (fired every step, not just
tool steps) now carries the step's token usage and accumulates it onto the
run row while streaming, so abort/failure/reaper settlement does not depend
on the happy-path `onEnd` callback. Accumulation is idempotent and
order-independent: the run stores a bounded set keyed by step number, absorbs
an exact redelivery, rejects a conflicting duplicate, and derives totals from
that set. The legacy `lastUsageStepNumber` field remains compatibility/audit
data, not the deduplication rule. The runtime drains every already-started
step write before any local abort/failure/completion mutation can revoke its
grant. Completion overwrites the accumulation with the SDK's authoritative
all-steps aggregate (the existing ai@7 `onEnd` behavior is preserved).

Title usage carries the concrete `routeId` that executed the call and its
`pricingRole` (`title` or `primary`). Settlement matches both only against the
reservation's corresponding immutable snapshot, so a retired title model that
falls back to the answer route is priced at the answer route's pinned rate. An
unknown or mismatched identity is logged and uses the conservative title
estimate; it never introduces an unpinned rate or rolls back completion. During
the Convex-first deployment window, the worker validator also accepts the prior
token-only evidence shape and prices it at the reserved title route. New
workers always send route-aware evidence.

All token counts accepted at worker boundaries must be finite, non-negative
safe integers. Pricing and bucket transitions use checked `bigint` arithmetic
and reject a value that cannot be represented as a safe integer before it can
become durable settlement evidence.

The stale-reservation reconciler (cron, batch-bounded, idempotent) is the
final net: old `reserved` rows whose run is terminal apply the boundary rule;
unattached old rows release; rows on non-terminal runs are left to the run
reapers. It never releases a reservation after provider work may have begun.

**Settlement evidence is grant-authorized only.** Because
`markGenerationRunCompleted.usage` (and the per-step usage on
`recordToolInvocations`) is now the authoritative settlement input, the
user-token registrations of the post-prepare run writes are removed: those
writes reach Convex only through ADR-0011's execution-grant worker wire
(`convex/chatRuntimeWorker.ts`, `requireGrantAuthorizedRun`). A chat owner
can therefore never call the settlement path directly and settle their own
platform reservation at a self-declared (near-zero) cost. `stopGenerationRun`
stays user-callable — it carries no usage input, and a stop settles under the
boundary rule above. The single-authenticator invariant is pinned by a test
in `convex/chatRuntime.test.ts`.

## Route resolver integration

The platform tier of ADR-0020's candidate walk becomes: entitlement rule
(model is platform-listed) → platform env credential exists → billable
pricing snapshot builds (fail closed) → **atomic reservation succeeds**. A
platform candidate is not eligible until its reservation lands; a failed
(insufficient) reservation falls through to the next platform candidate
(cheaper route) and then to fallback BYOK. At most one reservation survives
per request because the walk stops at the first success. New typed failure:
`insufficient_allowance` (mapped to a 403 `ALLOWANCE_EXHAUSTED` product
error). Route selection stays strictly before provider execution; no runtime
failover.

For authenticated users, platform funding additionally requires a **durable
chat** (reservation/settlement need the generation-run lifecycle); an
authenticated turn against a local chat id skips the platform tier.

### Authorization endpoint

The Next server calls only `usageAllowance.reserveAuthorized`; there is no
unsigned legacy reservation mutation or missing-function fallback. The HMAC
binds `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`, which the verifier compares with its own
`CONVEX_CLOUD_URL`, so a captured proof cannot cross deployments. Production
and Preview must not share `CHAT_ADMISSION_SECRET`; deployments needing a
stronger boundary from sibling previews should use per-preview secrets rather
than the shared Preview default.

The initial production rollout landed directly from a baseline that exposed no
reservation endpoint, so no old server depended on a legacy signature. Future
public mutation signature changes must use an explicit expand/contract rollout
when the active Next build depends on the old signature.

## Estimation and the output policy

`estimatePlatformUsage` (pure, documented heuristics): input ≈
⌈chars/4⌉ across system prompt + history + attachments allowance (a flat
per-image amount; PDFs at ~1,500 tokens per ~55 KB page of stored size, 2,000
when the size is unknown, all PDFs capped at the route's context window; files
the route cannot take count as their short note) + a flat tool allowance
when search/tools are enabled; output comes from ADR-0028's
route-aware generation-budget resolver. The platform response policy allows
**8,192 tokens**. Fixed Anthropic thinking adds separately billed reservation
headroom, while the provider adapter receives only the visible-answer portion
because the AI SDK adds the thinking budget itself. This prevents the old
double-addition bug. An explicit smaller user budget lowers the reservation;
it cannot raise the platform ceiling. The runtime spends that output allowance
cumulatively across all model steps, so a tool loop cannot multiply the
reserved output budget. Repeated input and other estimated dimensions can
still overrun; settlement records the actual charge honestly and may make the
balance negative. Estimation is admission control, not the final charge.

## Provider retention and attribution (amended 2026-09-27)

- **Retention.** OpenAI and xAI requests send `store: false` (Request
  shaping). Convex already holds each conversation, so a provider-stored
  response adds nothing. The SDKs then replay statelessly within a request:
  they request `reasoning.encrypted_content` themselves and send reasoning
  items inline between steps. The encrypted content rides each reasoning
  part's provider metadata and is persisted with the message (one copy per
  summary part, bounded by the message payload cap), but no later request
  replays it. History replay strips reasoning metadata (ADR-0041),
  and an approval continuation's paused step is history too (only its
  approval parts skip adaptation), so the SDK drops that reasoning and sends
  the id-less call and its output, as it did with storage on. Replaying it
  would tie the continuation to the key that produced it, and the route can
  change credentials between the pause and the continuation. Hosted-tool
  results are never replayed without storage, which is why historical hosted
  activity stays lowered to text (ADR-0029). OpenAI still keeps
  abuse-monitoring logs for up to 30 days; BYOK responses land in the key
  owner's organization.
- **Storage exception.** An OpenAI turn that offers hosted web search
  together with app-executed tools (Exa, content, MCP) keeps the default
  storage. With `store: false`, `@ai-sdk/openai` 4.0.45 drops the hosted
  `web_search_call` from later steps of the same request but still sends
  the reasoning item that preceded it; OpenAI requires every item since the
  last user message to be replayed untouched and rejects a reasoning item
  without its following item (vercel/ai#8379).
  Stored turns replay by `item_reference`, as before this amendment. The
  decision follows the request's search toggle and tool set, so toggling
  search while an approval is pending can flip the mode between the paused
  step and its continuation, and that rare continuation can fail with a
  provider error. Revisit when the SDK replays hosted calls inline. xAI is
  not excepted: its SDK drops hosted calls whatever `store` says.
- **Attribution.** Signed-in and guest requests carry one opaque actor id:
  the first 32 hex characters of HMAC-SHA-256 over
  `["provider-safety-identifier-v1", kind, id]`, keyed by
  `CHAT_ADMISSION_SECRET` (no new secret). `kind` is `user` with the WorkOS
  subject, or `guest` with the server-signed guest cookie id (ADR-0045), so a
  guest can never share a user's id. The Chat turn runtime derives it in one
  place; the browser-sent guest id is never an input. It goes out as OpenAI
  `safetyIdentifier`, Anthropic `metadata.userId`, and OpenRouter `user`
  (all per-request provider options); the xAI SDK has no field. Title calls
  carry the same options. It is never the email, cannot be reversed without the
  secret, and changes for everyone if the secret rotates; without a usable
  secret, none is sent.

## Existing counters

`users.dailyMessageCount` (and the ADR-0045 guest windows) remain **abuse
rate limits** only. The retired pro-model fields remain optional in the schema
only until production preflight proves older user rows can be contracted
safely. For signed-in users the chat route calls one `usage.admit` mutation
that checks and increments the counter in the same transaction, before the
credential source is known (guests are admitted by `usage.admitGuestTurn`
instead). This prevents concurrent requests from both passing a read-only
check at the final slot. Once admitted, the attempt counts even if later
credential or preparation work fails; this is abuse control, not economic
settlement. The economic admission remains the reservation itself.

## Alternatives considered

- **Mutable balance only** (LibreChat's balance schema): loses the audit
  trail, makes double-spend analysis and repair guesswork, and cannot
  explain a materialized number. Rejected — the ledger's cost is one extra
  insert per operation inside an already-open transaction.
- **Ledger only (derive balances by fold)**: every admission would read an
  unbounded row range; Convex charges per document read. Rejected in favor of
  materialized buckets with the ledger as evidence.
- **Check-then-debit split** (LibreChat's `checkBalance` middleware + later
  `spendTokens`): the TOCTOU race this design exists to remove. Rejected.
- **Charging from `priceUnit` strings / floats**: drift-prone and
  rounding-unsafe. Rejected — typed integer snapshot pinned per reservation.

**Consequences.** Priority BYOK structurally never writes allowance rows;
Fallback becomes "platform while affordable, then your key"; every platform
charge is explainable from the ledger; and a future purchased-overage bucket
is an ordered second `bucketKind` plus a reservation walk over ordered
buckets — no redesign of reserve/settle.
