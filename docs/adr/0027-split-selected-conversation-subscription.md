# ADR-0027: Split the selected-conversation subscription

**Status:** Accepted 2026-08-28; rollback removed 2026-08-30 after production
verification
**Date:** 2026-08-28

## Context

The former `messages.getSelectedConversation` subscription returned the
selected visible path and linked run state in one query. It was introduced as
atomic because "content and run state can never tear," but its measured cost
profile was excessive:

- Convex invalidation is read-set based. The atomic query reads every message
  in the chat, so EVERY write in the chat invalidates it — including writes
  that change nothing it projects.
- During a streaming turn the run doc is patched on every snapshot beat
  (`lastSnapshotSequence`/`lastProgressAt`, even when content dedupes),
  every heartbeat (10 s cadence), every tool step, and every approval
  transition. Each of those run-doc-only writes re-executed the full message
  collect and re-delivered the whole selected path (~23 KB measured) to every
  subscriber — per tab.
- Real conversations are dominated by exactly those content-free windows:
  thinking pauses, tool waits, approval waits.

The obvious alternative — indexing selected messages so the path query reads
fewer rows — is structurally unsafe and rejected: legacy chats have no branch
fields, `selected: undefined` messages are path-eligible, role-scoped
deselection leaves stale `selected: true` flags off-path, and sibling
ordering/descriptors need the whole order group. The path derivation must
remain the branch-context collect.

## Decision

Split the subscription into two queries on the same `readableChatQuery`
builder, both keyed by `chatId` alone:

1. **`getSelectedPath`** — the selected visible path, derived by the shared
   collect + `createBranchContext` code, plus a derived `pathVersion`
   fingerprint. Read set:
   chats/projects/users/messages only — run-doc writes no longer touch it.
2. **`getSelectedRunState`** — the tiny per-beat run facts
   (`SelectedRunProjection`, ~177 B measured). Owner-only. Its read set
   excludes the messages table entirely while the run is live (see the
   points-back trim below), so content beats no longer re-execute it either.

The §7 validation gauntlet splits across the seam:

- **Server-side** (in `getSelectedRunState`): run↔chat linkage, ownership,
  and points-back. Points-back short-circuits on
  `run.activeStreamId === run.assistantMessageId` — stamped at stream start,
  cleared on terminal transitions — which is decidable from the run doc
  alone. Only a settled run falls back to reading the linked message's
  `generationRunId` stamp (the doc is no longer written per beat then).
  When the short-circuit hits, the linked message's *existence* is not
  verified; a dangling id can never appear in the delivered path, so the
  client-side check below nulls exactly those cases.
- **Client-side** (messages provider): the on-selected-path check. The
  provider nulls the run unless its `assistantMessageId` is present in the
  DELIVERED path — the same predicate the atomic query evaluated
  server-side, applied to the same data.

### Why the client-side half does not reintroduce tearing

The historical warning — "do NOT wrap `getForChat` with an independent run
subscription" — was about subscriptions whose *arguments* derive from another
query's *result* (a second round trip against a moved database). That is
still forbidden. The split pair is different: one `ConvexReactClient` applies
every subscribed query's updates from a single transition atomically
(`browser/sync/remote_query_set`), and both queries take only `chatId`. Two
same-client, same-argument-source queries can never deliver values from
different database timestamps. The provider's on-path check therefore always
compares a run and a path from ONE transaction view — which is precisely why
the check could move client-side without weakening it.

This basis is Convex-client-scoped: it does NOT license split subscriptions
across different Convex clients, across argument-dependent queries, or
through any cache that decouples the two deliveries.

### Projection slimming

`SelectedRunProjection` drops `lastSnapshotSequence`, `lastProgressAt`, and
`activeToolNames` (zero production consumers; the first two forced a
re-delivery on every beat by construction), and `pendingApproval` shrinks to
`{expiresAt}` — presence and expiry are all the client reads; approval UI is
driven from message parts. No time-derived fields cross the wire: Convex
queries re-execute on data changes, never on wall-clock time, so freshness
classification stays client-side.

## Consequences

- Run-doc-only events (heartbeats, deduped beats, tool steps, approval
  bookkeeping) cost one ~177 B run-state delivery per subscriber instead of a
  ~23 KB path re-collect + re-delivery. Content beats still re-execute the
  path query — per-execution read cost is untouched by this ADR (that is
  Experiment 2b, range-bounded settled-history pagination, gated on
  prefix-derivability property tests).
- Tests pin owner and non-owner projection rules, server-side points-back
  validation, client-side on-path validation, and the live run query's narrow
  read set.
- The pause-heavy benchmark measured 98.6% less pause-window delivery
  (24 × 12.7 KB path re-collects became 24 × 177 B run-state deliveries),
  zero pause-caused path executions, live run-state reads shrinking from
  13 KB to 2 KB, and no meaningful durable-suite regression.
- On 2026-08-30, production verification found multiple Ready deployments
  after adoption and no `NEXT_PUBLIC_SPLIT_SELECTED_QUERY` production
  override. The deployed frontend already used the split pair, so the flag,
  atomic query, helper, and rollback-only tests were removed.
- 2026-09-27: `getSelectedPath` still reads every message in the chat,
  branches included, on each execution, so a chat's total message bytes stay
  bounded by Convex's 16 MiB per-function read limit. `prepareGeneration` now
  reads the chat once per turn (it read it about eight times, which failed
  from ~2 MiB chats) and each message is capped at 896 KiB (`capMessagePayload`,
  CONTEXT.md "Message payload cap"), so both sides hit that bound at the same
  ~16 MiB.
