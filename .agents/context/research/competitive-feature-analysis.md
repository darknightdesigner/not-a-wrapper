# Competitive Feature Analysis: Not A Wrapper vs. ChatGPT & Claude

> **Date**: February 6, 2026 (updated February 7, 2026)
> **Scope**: Web-based chat features of ChatGPT (chat.openai.com) and Claude (claude.ai) compared against the Not A Wrapper open-source codebase.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

- **ChatGPT** has evolved into a full-stack productivity platform with GPT-5, native image generation, deep research, agent mode (Operator integrated), an apps/connectors ecosystem (60+ apps on Business plan, with developer mode for unverified connectors), branching chats, tasks/scheduling with a dedicated schedules UI, orders/shopping, granular personalization (base style & tone, characteristics, profile info, record mode, per-feature toggles for search/code/canvas/voice), push and email notifications with per-category controls, comprehensive data controls (training opt-out, remote browser data, bulk archive/delete, shared links management), and robust account security (passkeys, MFA, per-device session management). Its six-tier pricing (Free → Go $8/mo → Plus $20/mo → Pro $200/mo → Business → Enterprise) covers every segment.
- **Claude** has differentiated through Artifacts (interactive app creation), connectors/MCP integrations (Google Workspace, Slack), memory across conversations (Pro), deep extended thinking, Projects with RAG, and Research mode. Its Max plan ($100-$200/mo) targets power users with 5-20x usage limits.
- **Not A Wrapper** has strong fundamentals — 10 providers, 73+ models, BYOK encryption, multi-model comparison, web search, projects, and sharing. However, it still has major feature gaps including no image generation, no code execution, no artifacts/canvas, no conversation export, no memory, no branching, no native integrations, no notifications, no granular personalization, no data controls beyond Clerk defaults, and no schedules/orders.
- The four highest-impact gaps to close remain: **(1) MCP integration into chat flow** (unlocks the "universal AI interface" positioning), **(2) Message reactions** (low-effort UX polish; drag-and-drop exists but needs minor accept/UX polish), **(3) Conversation export** (leapfrogs competitors who both have weak native export), and **(4) Artifacts/interactive outputs** (transformational). Additionally, ChatGPT's expanding platform features — notifications, granular personalization, schedules, orders, data controls, and passkey/MFA security — widen the "platform maturity" gap and should be tracked for future prioritization.
- Not A Wrapper's unique positioning (multi-provider, BYOK, open-source) is a genuine competitive moat. The roadmap should lean into this by becoming the **universal AI interface** rather than cloning any single provider's walled garden.

### 2.17 Prompt Box Interaction Patterns

These are the UX mechanisms users use to **discover and invoke features** directly from the chat input area. Both ChatGPT and Claude have converged on similar patterns, making them emerging conventions that users now expect.

#### `/` Slash Command Menu

Both platforms surface a popover menu when the user types `/` in the prompt box. This is the **primary discoverability mechanism** for input-level features.

| Menu Item | ChatGPT | Claude | Description |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Attach files/photos | Yes ("Add files or photos") | Yes ("Add photos & files") | Opens file picker for uploads |
| Screenshot capture | Yes ("Take a screenshot") | No | Capture and attach a screenshot |
| Add to project | Yes ("Add to project" → submenu) | No | Assign prompt to a project folder |
| Web search toggle | Yes ("Web search" ✓ toggle) | No | Enable/disable web search for this message |
| Style/tone presets | Yes ("Use style" → submenu) | No | Apply a writing style to the response |
| Image generation | No (auto-routed) | Yes ("Create image") | Invoke image generation mode |
| Deep research | No (model picker) | Yes ("Deep research") | Invoke multi-step research mode |
| Agent mode | No (model picker) | Yes ("Agent mode") | Enable autonomous agent behavior |
| Add sources | No | Yes ("Add sources") | Attach reference sources/context |
| Filter/search | Yes ("Type to filter" at bottom) | No | Filter menu items by typing |

**Key design observations:**
- **ChatGPT** uses `/` primarily for **input configuration** (what to attach, how to search, what style to use). Feature modes like deep research and agent are accessed via the model picker dropdown instead.
- **Claude** uses `/` primarily for **mode switching** (research, agent, image gen) plus basic file attachment. Configuration like web search lives elsewhere.
- Both show icons + labels for each item, with `>` chevrons for items that have submenus.
- ChatGPT includes a filter/search input at the bottom of the menu for discoverability at scale.
- Items can show state indicators (ChatGPT shows a checkmark `✓` next to "Web search" when enabled).

#### `@` Mention System (Integrations/Apps)

ChatGPT surfaces connected apps and integrations when the user types `@` in the prompt box. Claude does not have an equivalent `@` pattern on the web app.

| App/Integration | ChatGPT | Claude | Description |
|-----------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Shopping research | Yes | No | Product research and comparison |
| Figma | Yes | No | Access Figma designs and components |
| Instacart | Yes | No | Grocery ordering integration |
| OpenTable | Yes | No | Restaurant reservation integration |
| Adobe Acrobat | Yes | No | PDF tools and document processing |
| Google Drive | Yes | No | Access Drive files (connector-based) |
| Slack | Yes | No | Access Slack messages (connector-based) |
| _Custom connectors_ | Yes (developer mode) | No | User-added MCP/connector integrations |

**Key design observations:**
- The `@` menu is scoped exclusively to **external integrations/apps** — it's the tool invocation mechanism.
- Each item shows the app's icon/logo for instant recognition.
- Available items vary by plan (60+ on Business, fewer on Plus/Free).
- ChatGPT's `@` mention stays in the prompt as visible text (e.g., `@Figma design specs for...`), giving users a clear signal that a tool will be invoked.
- This pattern is analogous to `@`-mentioning a person in Slack/Discord — intuitive and well-understood.

#### Other Prompt Box Affordances

| Affordance | ChatGPT | Claude | Description |
|------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Persistent action buttons | Yes (attach, search, voice) | Yes (attach) | Always-visible icon buttons below/beside input |
| Model picker in input area | Yes (dropdown above input) | Yes (dropdown above input) | Switch models without leaving the prompt |
| Submit button position | Right side of input | Right side of input | Send message button |
| Multiline input | Yes (auto-expand) | Yes (auto-expand) | Input grows as user types |
| Keyboard submit | Enter (Shift+Enter for newline) | Enter (Shift+Enter for newline) | Standard submit pattern |
| Character/token indicator | No | No | Neither shows remaining capacity |
| Drag-drop overlay | Yes | Yes | Visual overlay when dragging files over input |

### 4b. Prioritized Gaps

#### P0 — Critical (Ship within 1-2 months)

These features close the most visible UX gaps and unlock the "universal AI interface" positioning. Item 1 (MCP) is the strategic priority and highest-impact work. Items 2-3 are small (0.5-2 days each) and should ship as a parallel UX polish sprint.

---

**1. MCP Integration into Chat Flow**

- **What competitors offer**: ChatGPT has an apps/connectors ecosystem (60+ apps on Business plan) and supports remote MCP servers/connectors; Claude supports connectors/MCP (e.g., Slack, Google Workspace). Both platforms are investing heavily in tool ecosystems.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: MCP client utilities exist (`lib/mcp/load-mcp-from-local.ts`, `lib/mcp/load-mcp-from-url.ts`) using `@ai-sdk/mcp`, but they are **not wired into the chat flow**. The chat route has `tools: {} as ToolSet` (empty).
- **Recommended approach**: Wire the existing MCP client into the chat route. Load tool definitions from configured MCP servers and pass them to `streamText()`. Add a Connections settings UI (the tab already exists as a placeholder) where users can add MCP server URLs. Add a trust model: allowlist servers, require per-tool approvals by default, and log tool calls for auditability. The existing `tool-invocation.tsx` component already renders tool calls, so the UI is partially ready.
- **Serverless constraint**: The chat API runs on Vercel serverless functions. **Scope the initial implementation to SSE/Streamable HTTP MCP servers only** — stdio-based servers require persistent processes incompatible with serverless. Stdio support would require a local proxy, desktop app sidecar, or a separate long-running service (future work).
- **Estimated complexity**: Medium (2-3 weeks, accounting for serverless constraints)
- **Dependencies**: Settings UI for server configuration; user-level MCP server storage in Convex; SSE-only transport in v1.

---

**2. Drag and Drop File Upload (Implemented, needs polish)**

- **What competitors offer**: Both ChatGPT and Claude support dragging files directly onto the chat interface.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: Drag-and-drop is already implemented globally via `FileUpload` and is wired in `ButtonFileUpload`. The drop overlay appears on drag. However, the file picker `accept` list only includes text + images, while validation allows PDF/CSV/JSON/Excel; this creates a UX mismatch.
- **Recommended approach**: Align the picker `accept` list with `lib/file-handling.ts` allowed types and consider a small affordance in the empty state to hint drag-and-drop. No backend changes required.
- **Estimated complexity**: Very small (0.5 day)
- **Dependencies**: None.

---

**3. Message Reactions / Feedback (Thumbs Up/Down)**

- **What competitors offer**: Both ChatGPT and Claude show thumbs up/down buttons on every assistant message. ChatGPT also allows written feedback. This data improves model selection and is a core UX convention users expect.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: A general `feedback` table exists in Convex (`convex/feedback.ts`) but there is no per-message reaction system.
- **Recommended approach**: Add a `reactions` field to the `messages` table schema (or a new `messageReactions` table). Add thumbs up/down buttons to `message-assistant.tsx` next to the existing copy/regenerate buttons. Store reactions optimistically using the existing pattern from `lib/chat-store/`. Consider a "report bad response" flow for safety.
- **Estimated complexity**: Small (1-2 days)
- **Dependencies**: Convex schema migration for `messages` or new table.

---

**4. Conversation Export (Markdown, JSON, PDF)**

- **What competitors offer**: Neither competitor has strong native per-conversation export. ChatGPT offers account data export (Settings > Data Controls > Export Data) producing a `.zip` with `chat.html`. Claude offers account data export via Settings > Privacy with an email download link. Individual export on both platforms requires third-party browser extensions.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: No export functionality exists. Share pages exist but only as public read-only URLs.
- **Why it's still P0**: Building per-conversation export would **leapfrog both competitors** on a feature users frequently request. It's also trivially easy given the existing message structure.
- **Recommended approach**: Add export buttons to the chat header dropdown. Generate Markdown from the existing `parts` message structure (which already contains structured text, code, reasoning). JSON export can serialize the raw message array directly from the messages provider. For PDF, start with an HTML export + browser "Print to PDF" flow, then add a PDF library if demand warrants.
- **Estimated complexity**: Small (1-2 days for Markdown + JSON; PDF follow-up if needed)
- **Dependencies**: None — all required data is already in the messages store and Convex.

---

#### P1 — Important (Ship within 3-6 months)

These features significantly improve retention and satisfaction. Users coming from ChatGPT or Claude will miss them.

---

**5. Code Execution Sandbox**

- **What competitors offer**: ChatGPT has a Python sandbox for data analysis, code execution, and chart generation. Claude's Artifacts can execute code interactively. Both can process datasets and visualize results.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: No code execution capability.
- **Recommended approach**: Integrate a sandboxed code execution service. Options: (a) WebAssembly-based browser sandbox using Pyodide for Python or (b) server-side sandbox via E2B (open-source, designed for AI agents) or CodeSandbox SDK. Render results inline using a new `CodeExecutionResult` component alongside the existing `tool-invocation.tsx` pattern. Start with JavaScript/TypeScript execution (lower complexity) then add Python.
- **Estimated complexity**: Large (1+ month)
- **Dependencies**: Third-party sandbox service or WASM runtime; new tool definition for the AI SDK.

---

**6. Artifacts / Interactive Output Panel**

- **What competitors offer**: ChatGPT Canvas enables side-by-side document/code editing with version history. Claude Artifacts create interactive apps, visualizations, and documents that users can customize and share.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: No artifact or canvas system.
- **Recommended approach**: Build a resizable side panel (similar to the existing `chat-preview-panel.tsx` pattern) that renders HTML/CSS/JS in a sandboxed iframe. Use a tool call convention (e.g., `createArtifact` tool) that the model calls to produce interactive content. Store artifacts as a new Convex table linked to messages. Enable sharing via existing public share infrastructure. Start simple: render static HTML/Markdown documents, then evolve to interactive React-based artifacts.
- **Estimated complexity**: Large (1+ month)
- **Dependencies**: Code execution sandbox (for interactive artifacts); new Convex table; iframe sandboxing.

---

**7. Cross-Conversation Memory**

- **What competitors offer**: ChatGPT stores memories automatically from conversations and via explicit "remember this" commands. Users can view, edit, and delete memories. Claude Pro has similar cross-conversation memory.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: No memory system. Users have a `systemPrompt` field for custom instructions, but no automatic or explicit memory persistence.
- **Recommended approach**: Create a `memories` table in Convex with `userId`, `content`, `source` (auto/explicit), `createdAt`. Add a `memoryTool` to the AI SDK tool set that the model can call to store new memories. Inject relevant memories into the system prompt before each `streamText()` call. Use Convex's built-in vector search for semantic memory retrieval (the database already supports RAG). Add a Memory management page in Settings.
- **Estimated complexity**: Medium (1-2 weeks)
- **Dependencies**: Convex vector search setup; new tool definition; system prompt injection logic.

---

**8. Conversation Branching / Forking**

- **What competitors offer**: ChatGPT allows branching conversations from any message to explore alternative response paths. Dual conversations can be carried on simultaneously.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: Message editing truncates and re-streams from the edit point (destructive). No way to preserve the original branch.
- **Recommended approach**: Modify the existing edit flow to optionally create a new chat (fork) instead of truncating. Copy messages up to the edit point into a new chat, then stream the new response. Add a `forkedFrom` field to the `chats` table to track lineage. The existing `ensureChatExists()` and `addBatch` mutation patterns handle the creation flow.
- **Estimated complexity**: Medium (1-2 weeks)
- **Dependencies**: Convex schema change for `chats` table; UI for fork action.

---

**9. Image Generation (via Provider APIs)**

- **What competitors offer**: ChatGPT has native image generation via GPT-4o. Users can generate and iteratively edit images within conversations.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: No image generation. The infrastructure for displaying images exists (image search results grid is renderer-only; attachment previews work).
- **Recommended approach**: Since Not A Wrapper already connects to OpenAI, add image generation as a tool call. Use the OpenAI Images API (`dall-e-3` or the new GPT-4o image model) via the existing BYOK key system. Render generated images using the existing `search-images.tsx` pattern. Gating: require BYOK OpenAI key or Pro plan. This leverages existing provider infrastructure without building a generation engine.
- **Estimated complexity**: Medium (1-2 weeks)
- **Dependencies**: OpenAI API key (via BYOK); new tool definition; image result rendering component.

---

**10. Chat Archiving**

- **What competitors offer**: Both platforms support archiving conversations — hiding them from the main list without deletion.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: Chats can only be deleted, not archived.
- **Recommended approach**: Add an `archived` boolean field and `archivedAt` timestamp to the `chats` table. Filter archived chats from the default sidebar query. Add an "Archived" section accessible from the sidebar or settings. Reuse the existing context menu pattern from `sidebar-item.tsx`.
- **Estimated complexity**: Small (1-2 days)
- **Dependencies**: Convex schema migration.

---

**11. Deep Research Mode**

- **What competitors offer**: ChatGPT Deep Research autonomously browses hundreds of sources over 5-30 minutes to produce comprehensive cited reports (usage limits by plan; Free 5, Plus/Team/Enterprise 25, Pro 250). Claude has Research mode for extended analysis (included in Pro tier). Both platforms feature deep research prominently — it's becoming a flagship capability.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: Web search exists per-message but no multi-step research.
- **Why P1 (not P2)**: Deep research is now a headline feature on both major competitors and is included in their standard paid tiers. For a "universal AI interface," the inability to do multi-step research is a more noticeable gap than team workspaces or custom agents. It also builds directly on existing web search infrastructure and the MCP integration being prioritized at P0.
- **Recommended approach**: Build as an agent workflow using the existing web search infrastructure, but run it in a background job/queue to handle 5-30 minute tasks. Persist progress (steps + sources) and stream status updates to a progress UI component. Use a dedicated "research" system prompt that instructs the model to decompose queries, search iteratively, and synthesize. Leverage models with large context windows (Gemini 2.0, Claude Sonnet 4.5) for synthesis.
- **Estimated complexity**: Large (1+ month)
- **Dependencies**: MCP integration (for richer tool use); progress UI component.

---

**12. Enhanced Keyboard Shortcuts**

- **What competitors offer**: ChatGPT has 10+ keyboard shortcuts for common actions (copy conversation, toggle focus mode, voice input, etc.).
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: Only `Cmd+K` for command palette.
- **Recommended approach**: Add shortcuts for: new chat (`Cmd+N`), toggle sidebar (`Cmd+B`), toggle search (`Cmd+Shift+S`), focus input (`/`), copy last response (`Cmd+Shift+C`). Use the existing command palette infrastructure to register and discover shortcuts. Add a keyboard shortcut help dialog (`Cmd+/` or `?`).
- **Estimated complexity**: Small (1-2 days)
- **Dependencies**: None.

---

#### P2 — Nice to Have (6-12 month horizon)

These provide competitive differentiation but aren't adoption blockers.

---

**13. Team Workspaces**

- **What competitors offer**: ChatGPT Business/Enterprise and Claude Team/Enterprise offer shared workspaces with role-based access, shared projects, and admin controls.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: Single-user only. Clerk supports organizations but no multi-tenant logic exists.
- **Recommended approach**: Leverage Clerk's organization features for team management. Add an `organizationId` field to chats, projects, and user preferences. Create team-level BYOK key pools. Add admin settings for team-wide model restrictions and usage limits.
- **Estimated complexity**: Large (1+ month)
- **Dependencies**: Clerk organization setup; Convex schema changes; new admin UI.

---

**14. Custom Agents / GPTs**

- **What competitors offer**: ChatGPT's GPT Builder lets users create custom agents with specific instructions, knowledge bases, and tool access. The GPT Store has thousands of community-created agents.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: Sub-agent architecture is planned but only type definitions and placeholder code exist.
- **Recommended approach**: Build on the existing sub-agent types in `lib/ai/sub-agents/`. Create a simple agent builder UI: name, system prompt, model selection, optional knowledge files (using Convex storage). Store agent configs in a new `agents` table. Allow users to select agents like they select models. Community sharing can reuse the existing public share infrastructure.
- **Estimated complexity**: Large (1+ month)
- **Dependencies**: Sub-agent architecture implementation; knowledge file RAG.

---

**15. Audio Input/Output (Voice Mode)**

- **What competitors offer**: ChatGPT has real-time voice mode with emotive speech synthesis across web, desktop, and mobile.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: No audio capabilities.
- **Recommended approach**: Use the Web Speech API for speech-to-text input (browser-native, no backend needed). For output, integrate a TTS provider (OpenAI's TTS API, ElevenLabs, or browser-native `SpeechSynthesis`). Add a microphone button to the chat input. Voice mode can be a toggle that auto-submits after speech ends.
- **Estimated complexity**: Medium (1-2 weeks)
- **Dependencies**: TTS provider API key (via BYOK or platform); browser API compatibility.

---

**16. Onboarding Flow**

- **What competitors offer**: Both ChatGPT and Claude have first-time user flows explaining capabilities, model selection, and key features.
- **Current state in Not A Wrapper**: No onboarding. Users land directly in the chat interface.
- **Recommended approach**: Build a lightweight 3-4 step onboarding modal: (1) Welcome + choose theme, (2) Select preferred model, (3) Optional BYOK key setup, (4) Feature highlights (multi-model, web search, projects). Store `onboardingCompleted` in user preferences. Show only once.
- **Estimated complexity**: Small (1-2 days)
- **Dependencies**: None.

---

### 4c. Unique Strengths

Not A Wrapper has **six distinct competitive advantages** that neither ChatGPT nor Claude can match:

| Strength | Why It Matters | How to Lean In |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Multi-Model Comparison** | No other platform lets users compare 10 models side-by-side on the same prompt. This is uniquely valuable for developers evaluating models, researchers benchmarking, and power users optimizing. | Add comparison analytics (token count, latency, cost per response). Allow saving comparison results. Create a "Model Arena" feature for blind comparisons with voting. |
| **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** | Enterprise users and privacy-conscious individuals can use their own API keys with zero data passing through third-party servers. AES-256-GCM encryption is enterprise-grade. | Highlight cost savings (vs. $20-200/mo subscriptions). Show estimated cost per conversation. Add BYOK for more providers (Cohere, Together AI). Enterprise: team-level key pools. |
| **100+ Models / 10 Providers** | ChatGPT locks users to OpenAI models. Claude locks users to Anthropic models. Not A Wrapper is the universal interface — try any model without separate accounts. | Build a model recommendation engine ("best model for coding", "best for creative writing"). Show model capability comparisons. Add new providers quickly via the established skill system. |
| **Open Source** | Full transparency, community contributions, no vendor lock-in. No other major AI chat app offers this combination of features as open source. | Invest in documentation, contribution guides, and community. Accept PRs for new providers and features. Offer a managed hosted version. Create a plugin/extension system for community-built features. |
| **Command Palette (Cmd+K)** | Neither ChatGPT nor Claude has a command palette. Power users love keyboard-driven interfaces. | Expand to include actions (new chat, toggle search, switch model, change theme) beyond just chat search. Make it the central command hub. |

### 4d. Strategic Recommendations

**1. "Universal AI Interface" Positioning**

Not A Wrapper should not try to clone ChatGPT or Claude feature-for-feature. Instead, lean into the positioning of being the **one interface for all AI** — the place where users come because they want choice, transparency, and control. Every feature decision should pass the test: "Does this reinforce our multi-provider, user-first identity?"

**Action**: Frame marketing around "One app. Every AI model. Your keys." Focus roadmap on cross-model features (comparison, routing, memory that works across providers) rather than single-provider features.

---

**2. MCP as the Integration Layer (Build vs. Integrate)**

Rather than building native integrations for Google Drive, GitHub, Slack, etc. (which would require enormous ongoing maintenance), leverage MCP as the universal integration protocol. Not A Wrapper already has MCP client code — wiring it into the chat flow and adding a configuration UI would instantly enable hundreds of community MCP servers. This is the single most strategically important feature to ship.

**Action**: Complete MCP integration (P0 #1) and position it as a core differentiator: "Connect any tool via MCP — no walled garden." Build a curated MCP server directory. Start with SSE/Streamable HTTP transport only (serverless-compatible). Default to allowlists and per-tool approvals with audit logging to mitigate tool risks. This aligns with open-source values and scales via community.

---

**3. Ship the "UX Polish Sprint" Immediately (Drag & Drop polish, Reactions, Export)**

These P0 items are small complexity. Reactions/export are missing, and drag-and-drop needs minor UX/picker alignment. Ship them in parallel with MCP work to bring the product to baseline parity in the areas users most commonly notice. Note: per-conversation export would actually **leapfrog** both ChatGPT and Claude, neither of which offers native per-conversation export (both only have bulk data exports).

**Action**: Prioritize drag-and-drop polish (accept list + affordance), thumbs up/down reactions, and export (Markdown + JSON first; PDF follow-up if needed) as a single 1-week sprint.

---

**4. Artifacts as the "Killer Feature" for Multi-Model**

Artifacts are transformational in Claude and Canvas in ChatGPT. For Not A Wrapper, the unique twist is: **artifacts that work with any model**. Users could generate an artifact with Claude, then iterate on it with GPT-5, then refine with Gemini — all in the same panel. No other tool enables this.

**Action**: Prioritize a basic artifact system (P1) that renders HTML/Markdown/code in a side panel. Design it model-agnostic from day one. This becomes the crown jewel of the "universal AI interface" narrative.

---

**5. Open Source Community as a Feature Multiplier**

ChatGPT has hundreds of engineers building features. Not A Wrapper can match output by building the right extension points for community contributions. The skills system, MCP integration, and model provider abstraction are already excellent extension points.

**Action**: Create a contributor guide specifically for: (a) adding new AI providers, (b) building MCP tool servers, (c) creating artifact templates. Host community "model of the month" additions. Accept PRs for the simpler P1/P2 features.

---

**6. Invest in the "AI Power User" Persona**

ChatGPT is optimizing for mainstream consumers. Claude is optimizing for professional workflows. Not A Wrapper's natural audience is the **AI power user** — developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who want control, comparison, and customization. Every feature should serve this persona first.

**Action**: Prioritize features that power users care about: keyboard shortcuts, export, BYOK cost tracking, model comparison analytics, local model support. De-prioritize consumer features like voice mode and accent color customization.

---

**7. Model-Agnostic Memory as Strategic Differentiation**

Both ChatGPT and Claude memory systems are locked to their respective providers. Not A Wrapper could build **memory that works across all models** — your preferences, facts, and context travel with you regardless of which model you're talking to. This is a powerful retention mechanism and genuine innovation.

**Action**: Build memory (P1) using Convex's built-in vector search for semantic retrieval. Store memories provider-agnostically. Inject relevant memories into any model's system prompt. This becomes a moat: once users build up memory in Not A Wrapper, switching cost is high.

---

**8. BYOK + Tools: Define the Billing & Access Model**

Several planned features (image generation, code execution, MCP tools, deep research) consume API credits or require specific provider keys. The current BYOK model works well for chat, but tool-based features introduce new questions: Who pays for tool calls? How do you rate-limit tool usage separately from chat? What happens when a user's BYOK key doesn't support a needed tool (e.g., image generation requires an OpenAI key, but the user only has an Anthropic key)?

**Action**: Design a clear access model before building P1 tool-dependent features. Options include: (a) all tool calls use the user's BYOK key for the relevant provider, (b) platform-subsidized tools on the Pro plan, (c) hybrid where users can choose. Document this as an ADR in `.agents/context/decisions/`.

---

**9. Monetization Strategy in a $8/mo World**

ChatGPT now offers six tiers from Free to Enterprise, including a Go plan at **$8/mo** (with ads). Claude has Free, Pro ($20/mo), and Max ($100-200/mo). Not A Wrapper's pricing strategy needs to account for this landscape. The open-source model is a strength, but the managed hosted version needs a clear value proposition at a competitive price point.

**Action**: Define pricing tiers for the managed hosted version. Consider: Free (limited models, rate-limited) → Pro ($X/mo, all models, higher limits, export, MCP) → Team ($Y/user/mo, shared BYOK pools, admin controls). The BYOK model is a natural differentiator — users who bring their own keys pay less because they're covering API costs directly.

## 5. Appendix: Feature Detail Cards

### Card 1: Conversation Export

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Gap Level** | P0 — Critical (leapfrog opportunity) |
| **Competitors** | ChatGPT: Account data export only (Settings > Data Controls > zip with `chat.html`); no native per-conversation export — requires third-party extensions. Claude: Account data export via Settings > Privacy (email download link). Neither has native per-conversation PDF/MD export. |
| **Current State** | No export. Messages stored in Convex (`convex/messages.ts`) with `parts` array (AI SDK format). Share pages render messages server-side. |
| **Technical Approach** | Add `ExportMenu` dropdown to chat header. Markdown: iterate `parts`, render text/code/reasoning into Markdown string. JSON: serialize messages array directly. PDF: start with HTML export + browser "Print to PDF"; consider a PDF library later if demand warrants. |
| **Files to Modify** | `app/components/chat/chat.tsx` (header), new `lib/export/` utilities, `app/components/chat/export-menu.tsx` |
| **Complexity** | Small (1-2 days for Markdown + JSON; PDF follow-up if needed) |

### Card 2: Message Reactions

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Gap Level** | P0 — Critical |
| **Competitors** | Both ChatGPT and Claude show thumbs up/down on every assistant message. ChatGPT also allows written feedback and model correction. |
| **Current State** | General `feedback` table exists but no per-message reactions. `message-assistant.tsx` has copy and regenerate buttons in the action bar. |
| **Technical Approach** | Add `messageReactions` table: `{ messageId, chatId, userId, reaction: "up" | "down", createdAt }`. Add thumbs buttons to `message-assistant.tsx` action bar. Optimistic updates using existing pattern. Optional: "Tell us more" dialog on thumbs down. |
| **Files to Modify** | `convex/schema.ts`, new `convex/reactions.ts`, `app/components/chat/message-assistant.tsx` |
| **Complexity** | Small (1-2 days) |

### Card 3: MCP Chat Integration

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Gap Level** | P0 — Critical |
| **Competitors** | ChatGPT: apps/connectors ecosystem (60+ apps on Business plan) and remote MCP servers. Claude: connectors/MCP (e.g., Slack, Google Workspace). Both use MCP as the underlying protocol. |
| **Current State** | `lib/mcp/load-mcp-from-local.ts` and `lib/mcp/load-mcp-from-url.ts` exist with working `createMCPClient()` implementations. Not wired into `app/api/chat/route.ts` — tools are `{} as ToolSet`. Settings Connections tab is a placeholder. |
| **Technical Approach** | (1) Add `mcpServers` table in Convex: `{ userId, name, url, transport: "sse" | "streamable-http" }`. (2) Build Connections settings UI to add/remove MCP servers. (3) In chat route, load user's MCP servers, create clients, aggregate tools into the `tools` parameter for `streamText()`. (4) Add an allowlist + per-tool approval model and log tool calls for auditability. (5) Tool results already render via `tool-invocation.tsx`. **Note**: V1 scoped to SSE/Streamable HTTP only — stdio requires persistent processes incompatible with Vercel serverless. |
| **Files to Modify** | `convex/schema.ts`, new `convex/mcpServers.ts`, `app/api/chat/route.ts`, `app/components/layout/settings/connections-tab.tsx` |
| **Complexity** | Medium (2-3 weeks, accounting for serverless constraints) |

### Card 4: Code Execution Sandbox

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Gap Level** | P1 — Important |
| **Competitors** | ChatGPT: Python sandbox for data analysis, charts, file processing (file limits apply; 512MB per file, 10GB user cap). Claude: Code execution in Artifacts with live preview. |
| **Current State** | No code execution. Code is only rendered with syntax highlighting. |
| **Technical Approach** | Option A (recommended): Integrate E2B (open-source, AI-native sandbox). Create a `codeExecution` tool definition for the AI SDK. On tool call, send code to E2B, return stdout/stderr/files. Render results in a new `CodeResult` component. Option B: Browser-side WASM (Pyodide for Python, QuickJS for JS) — lower latency but limited capabilities. |
| **Files to Modify** | New `lib/tools/code-execution.ts`, new `app/components/chat/code-result.tsx`, `app/api/chat/route.ts` (add tool) |
| **Complexity** | Large (1+ month) |

### Card 5: Artifacts / Interactive Output Panel

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Gap Level** | P1 — Important |
| **Competitors** | ChatGPT Canvas: Side-by-side editor for documents and code with version history, shortcuts, collaborative editing. Claude Artifacts: Interactive apps, documents, and visualizations with MCP integration and sharing. |
| **Current State** | No artifact system. `chat-preview-panel.tsx` exists as a conversation preview side panel — similar layout pattern. |
| **Technical Approach** | (1) New `artifacts` Convex table: `{ chatId, messageId, type, content, title, version }`. (2) Resizable side panel component (extend `chat-preview-panel.tsx` pattern). (3) Sandboxed iframe for rendering HTML/CSS/JS artifacts. (4) `createArtifact` tool definition that models can call. (5) Version history using Convex's built-in document versioning. (6) **Unique angle**: Artifacts work with any model — generate with Claude, iterate with GPT-5. |
| **Files to Modify** | `convex/schema.ts`, new `convex/artifacts.ts`, new `app/components/chat/artifact-panel.tsx`, `app/api/chat/route.ts` |

### Card 6: Cross-Conversation Memory

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Gap Level** | P1 — Important |
| **Competitors** | ChatGPT: Automatic + explicit memory. Saved memories and chat history insights. Management UI for viewing/editing/deleting. Available on all tiers. Claude: Memory on Pro plans. Cross-conversation context persistence. |
| **Current State** | No memory system. `systemPrompt` in `users` table is the closest analog (manual custom instructions). Convex supports vector search natively (built-in RAG mentioned in AGENTS.md). |
| **Technical Approach** | (1) New `memories` table: `{ userId, content, source: "auto" | "explicit", embedding, createdAt }`. (2) `memoryTool` for AI SDK: model calls to store/recall memories. (3) On each chat request, vector-search top-K relevant memories and inject into system prompt. (4) Memory management page in Settings. (5) **Unique**: Memories work across all models — your context travels with you. |
| **Files to Modify** | `convex/schema.ts`, new `convex/memories.ts`, `app/api/chat/route.ts` (memory injection), new settings page |
| **Complexity** | Medium (1-2 weeks) |
